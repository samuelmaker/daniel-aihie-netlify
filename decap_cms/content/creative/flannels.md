## ‘Flannels x Beauty’, Role: Design & Editor

I was contacted by Flannels and Platform13 to create visual assets for Flannels Beauty launch.

I was tasked with the role of designing and editing content for their social platform.

Using creative writing I used voice-over from the talent to narrate this piece of content, to engage with the products, and use their key talking points to expand onto the wider subject of sustainable products and their benefits.

This content involved a reel for Flannels social channels and full film videos at an aspect ratio of 16:9 for paid and internal comms at Flannels.
