## ‘VIRGIL ABLOH x BENJI B INTERVIEW’ Role: CREATIVE, PRODUCED & FILMED



I was contacted by Benji B production team to creatively produce visual content that is as highly engaging as the audio experience.  

I was tasked with curating various topics encapsulating Virgil Abloh's journey across fashion, music, and diverse influences. From his ground-breaking designs to his cultural impact, each discussion offered insight into the multifaceted nature of his creative odyssey, inviting audiences to explore the essence of Abloh's visionary work.

As the studio's art director where the interview unfolded, my role was to orchestrate the visual narrative, ensuring that every captured frame resonated with our creative vision. I storyboarded the conversation, crafting a visual roadmap that guided us toward achieving our aesthetic objectives. Through strategic direction and thoughtful curation, I ensured that each moment of the dialogue was not just heard, but visually felt, immersing the audience in a captivating visual journey.
