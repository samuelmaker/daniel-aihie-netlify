## ‘CLAVISH x YOUTUBE MUSIC’, Role: DESIGN 



I was contacted by Polydor to design visual assets for Clavish collaboration with YouTube Music. 

As Clavish, recently had his first LP debut at No.4 on the chart Polydor as well as YouTube Music wanted to make sure all eyes were on U.K’s future rap star.

I was tasked with the role of designing visual assets for both online and his sold-out live show sponsored by YouTube Music. 

To encourage people who were not able to get tickets I made designs outlining the concert can be live streamed from the Clavish YouTube platform where they can still experience the live show. This design lived on TikTok, Twitter & Instagram. 

I was also tasked with the role of editing content for the live show and social media.
