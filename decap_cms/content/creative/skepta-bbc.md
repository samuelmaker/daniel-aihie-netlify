**‘SKEPTA AT BBC LIVE AT MAIDA VALE’, Role: Creative & Concepting**

As a creative and content creator at the BBC, my role was to bring music concepts to life on socials and TV. This creative idea was to film Skepta’s live performance uniquely for the exclusive launch of his album Ignorance is Bliss and get people talking about it.

Drawing inspiration from the album art, we wanted to experiment with thermal cameras to capture the performance:

From the full-length live performance/ Interview that lived on iPlayer, we created clips of each performed song that lived on BBC socials (for YouTube, Instagram, and Meta) showcasing all songs performed in the main full–length show.
