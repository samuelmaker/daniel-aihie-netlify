## ​​Client Tom Mundi aka 020Whitton - Task was how do we create a visual representation showcasing his latest aliases.

 

To create a visual representation for 020Whitton that encapsulates the nostalgic eras of dance music while incorporating modern elements, we decided to focus on the evolution of mobile phones as a central motif. By blending iconic designs of vintage mobile phones from the late 90s and early 2000s with the sleek aesthetics of today's smartphones, we aim to symbolize the progression of 020Whitton's music.

This approach will be reflected across single covers, social media graphics, and promotional videos, offering the audience a nostalgic yet fresh experience. Throughout the campaign, the unifying element of the mobile phone will provide continuity, striking a delicate balance between piquing the audience's interest and offering glimpses of what they can expect from 020Whitton's upcoming releases.
