## Omar Apollo x Youth To The People’ Role: Editor



Client Youth To The People - Task was how do we create a visual representation showcasing the key to wellness. 

As an editor collaborating closely with director Christelle De Castro on this project, our aim for the brand film is to introduce YTTP to the audience in an unconventional manner, showcasing skincare in a fresh light. By bypassing cliché product shots, we focus on highlighting the essence of what makes us beautifully human. With the assistance of our new ambassador, Omar Apollo, we delve into the authentic and relatable aspects of our shared human experience, creating a narrative that resonates deeply with viewers.

The film celebrates the essence of youthfulness and wellness, embracing authenticity and the pursuit of joy. It champions the courage to be oneself while embracing imperfections as integral to our individuality. Through heartfelt storytelling, we invite viewers to join us on a journey of self-discovery and self-love, where embracing our true selves is the ultimate act of beauty and empowerment.
