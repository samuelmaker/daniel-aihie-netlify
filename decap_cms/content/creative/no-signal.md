## 'NO SIGNAL NS YEARBOOK’ Role: Creative Direction & Concept

Client No Signal – Task with creating a brand-new concept in which we can showcase and champion emerging/established talent.

As a creative lead, I wanted a format that would resonate with the audience by aligning it with something that most people in the U.K. and worldwide have experienced 'School Picture Day'. But also use that as a beacon for the talent that would feature on the list.

**Building the campaign:**

* T-shirts, NS school uniforms, and having them signed by the artist
* Individual shots
* Clothes Talent with black own clothing brands
* Create a visible link with our academy, linking it to the importance of schooling, opportunities, and education.
* Launch an official Spotify playlist

The billboards were showcased across the U.K. and featured across social media, cementing No Signal's place in the music scene and cultivating a culture for tastemaker
