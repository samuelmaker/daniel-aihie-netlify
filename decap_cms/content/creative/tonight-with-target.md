### ‘Iconic Spaces’, Role: Creative &  Art Direction & Editing

Our Client - DJ Target & New Wave – Tonight with Target was a newly commissioned TV show by the BBC and it needed segments to broadcast outside the live studio to enhance its reach.  

As a creative and producer at the BBC/Fremantle my role was to bring the off-shoot segments to life concepting and executing ideas that differ from the Live Studio Content.

This came with the team and me researching countless Iconic venues in the U.K and strategically planning which artists best suited the art direction that would emphasise the meaning of the segment (Iconic).

Achieving over 900k Instagram views, the commissioning of Season 2, and my first IMDb credit.
